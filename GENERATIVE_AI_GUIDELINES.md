# Guidelines for Students Using Generative AI in Challenge Projects

## Overview: Embracing GenAI Responsibly
Generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot, and others) can be powerful aids that spark creativity and assist with coding and problem-solving in engineering and science projects. Our program allows (and even encourages) the use of GenAI to enhance your work ‚Äì from brainstorming ideas to writing and debugging code. With that opportunity comes responsibility: whether you are a senior undergraduate or a PhD student, you must use AI transparently and with academic integrity, ensuring you understand, verify, and can explain the work you submit. The guidelines below show how to incorporate GenAI effectively into capstones, theses, and other project work while upholding the standards of our program and the academic community.

## 1. Use AI as a Supplement ‚Äì Not a Substitute for Your Own Work
- **Maintain Your Own Thought Process:** Always apply your own critical thinking and creativity first. Use AI to explore alternatives or get hints, but don‚Äôt let it make decisions for you.
- **Avoid Over-Reliance:** Don‚Äôt copy-paste large AI-generated answers without modification. Treat AI output as a draft or inspiration that you will refine and verify.
- **Learning is the Priority:** The purpose of academic projects is for you to learn and demonstrate your expertise. AI should enhance, not bypass, the learning process.

## 2. Always Review, Understand, and Test AI-Generated Code
- **Thoroughly Review AI Suggestions:** Carefully read and understand every line of code the AI provides. Never include code you cannot explain.
- **Test and Validate Functionality:** Rigorously test any AI-generated code with multiple test cases and edge cases. Submissions with non-functional code will not be accepted.
- **Debug and Refine as Needed:** Treat AI output as a starting point. Refactor, optimize, or correct it as needed.
- **Check Against Official Documentation:** AI may use outdated syntax or functions. Verify against official documentation (e.g., MathWorks, Python, etc.).
- **Ensure Toolbox Compatibility and Leverage Built-in Features:** GenAI may miss newer built-in functions, suggest incorrect toolboxes, or create custom functions that duplicate existing ones already available in MathWorks toolboxes. Always verify that the code uses the correct toolbox, aligns with your installed and licensed features, and doesn‚Äôt overlook efficient built-in solutions for your task.

## 3. Be Prepared to Explain and Justify Your Solution
- **Demonstrate Your Understanding:** You must be able to walk through your code and explain how it works, why you chose it, and how you verified it.
- **Expect Evaluation of Understanding:** You may be asked to defend your solution or modify it during evaluation.
- **No "Black Boxes":** Submissions should not contain unexplained or poorly understood code.

## 4. Acknowledge AI Assistance and Other Sources
- **Follow Academic Integrity Standards:** If you used GenAI to generate a significant part of your project, acknowledge the tool in your report or code.
- **When to Acknowledge:** If AI contributed anything non-trivial (e.g., a function or paragraph), cite it with a note or code comment.
- **Citation Format:** Mention the tool and its role (e.g., ‚ÄúUsed ChatGPT to help optimize data sorting logic‚Äù). Formal citations are not required unless specified.

## 5. Uphold Ethical and Academic Standards
- **No Cheating or Plagiarism:** Do not use AI in contexts where it is prohibited. Misuse of AI is considered academic misconduct.
- **Do Not Fabricate or Falsify Data/Results:** Never use AI to generate fake data, analysis, or citations.
- **Protect Confidential Information:** Do not submit sensitive or proprietary information to public AI tools.
- **Keep Records of AI Interactions:** Save your AI prompts or chat logs in case questions arise about your process.

## 6. Consequences of Misuse (When Guidelines Are Not Followed)
- **Submissions Must Meet These Standards:** Code that is not tested, not understood, or clearly AI-generated without integration will be rejected.
- **Loss of Credit or Rewards:** Misuse may result in loss of program rewards, credit, or academic penalties.
- **Damage to Reputation and Learning:** Submitting misunderstood AI work undermines your learning and can affect your credibility.
- **Trust and Future Opportunities:** Repeated or serious violations may limit your access to future projects.

## 7. Conclusion: Harness AI to Learn and Innovate
Used wisely, Generative AI is a powerful learning aid and productivity booster. Keep yourself in the driver‚Äôs seat: review all AI outputs, verify results, understand what you submit, and follow ethical practices. Your submissions should reflect your understanding and growth, with AI as a tool ‚Äî not a crutch.

## üìÖ Generative AI Usage Code of Conduct for Student Projects

1. **Use AI as a Support Tool, Not a Substitute**  
   Do your own thinking first. Use GenAI to explore ideas or enhance your work‚Äînot to replace your effort.

2. **Understand What You Submit**  
   You must be able to explain, justify, and reproduce any AI-generated code or content you submit.

3. **Review and Test All AI-Generated Code**  
   Never submit code you haven‚Äôt tested or understood. You‚Äôre responsible for all errors and outputs.

4. **No Blind Copy-Pasting**  
   Don‚Äôt paste unverified AI answers into your solution. Refine and adapt everything before submission.

5. **Acknowledge Significant AI Contributions**  
   Clearly state when and how you used GenAI tools (e.g., in code comments, project reports, or acknowledgments).

6. **Do Not Use AI to Fabricate or Mislead**  
   Submissions must reflect real work. Do not use AI to fake results, generate false data, or misrepresent your contributions.

7. **Respect Privacy and Security**  
   Do not input confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information into public AI tools.

8. **Follow the Rules of the Program and Institution**  
   If AI use is prohibited or restricted in a specific context, follow those restrictions.

9. **Own the Final Outcome**  
   You are the author of your submission. AI is a tool‚Äîyou are responsible for the correctness, clarity, and quality of your work.

10. **Submissions That Violate These Rules May Be Rejected**  
    Submissions that include misunderstood, untested, or misused AI content will not be accepted for evaluation or rewards.

11. **Use the Right Tools ‚Äî Not Just AI Suggestions**  
    GenAI may miss recent or toolbox-specific features. Make sure the code uses the correct toolbox, available licensed features, and doesn‚Äôt ignore newer, built-in solutions already offered by platforms like MathWorks.
